    <h1>HTML Text Formatting</h1>
    <ol> 
       <h3>1. Strong</h3>
        <ul style="background-color: antiquewhite;">
            <li>The strong tag is used to define text with strong importance</li>
            <li>The content inside is typically displayed in bold.</li>
            <li>Another accepted use for strong is to denote the labels of paragraphs which represent notes or warnings within the text of a page.</li>
        </ul>
       <h3>2. Mark</h3>
       <ul style="background-color: beige;">
        <li>When used in a quotation or block quote. </li>
        <li> it generally indicates text which is of special interest but is not marked in the original source material,</li>
        <li> Think of this like using a highlighter pen in a book to mark passages that you find of interest.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>3. Del</h3>
       <ul  style="background-color: rgb(102, 102, 151);">
        <li>The del HTML element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document</li>
        <li>This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example</li>
        <li>The ins element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.</li>
        
       </ul>
        
    </ol>
