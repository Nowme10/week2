Nesting operators
Child: >

You can use (>) operator to nest elements inside each other:
div>ul>li

<div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</div>


Sibling: +

Use (+) operator to place elements near each other, on the same level:

div+p+bq

...will output

<div></div>
<p></p>
<blockquote></blockquote>


Climb-up: ^

With (>) operator youâ€™re descending down the generated tree and positions of all sibling elements will be resolved against the most deepest element:

div+div>p>span+em 

...will be expanded to

<div></div>
<div>
    <p><span></span><em></em></p>
</div>
